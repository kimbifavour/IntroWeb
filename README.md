# Recreation

This repository is simply me trying to recreate one of the website designs I did on Figma

# Why?

Bcause why not? ðŸ˜… 
I'm the type of UI designer that creates stuff that no one would want to code because it's not functional. 
So I want to use these 'non-functional' designs to learn the ins and outs of front-end design.
